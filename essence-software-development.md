# Essence of Software Development

- Composition
- Failsafe
- Single Point of failure: If there is a single point of failure, by every safety standard I have ever seen, it is by definition unsafe, and no amount of countermeasures, no amount of failsafes will fix that. They will reduce how often it happens, but it won't completely fix it. Because we have millions of vehicles out there, it will find a way to fail that you didn't think of, and it will fail.
